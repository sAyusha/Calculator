# Simple Calculator Assignment
In this assignment of creating calculaor for basic calculation, I have used tkinter in python. I have imported everything from tkinter and created a main screen named window.
I have used different geometry and widget like grid(),place(),Button(),Entry() to create this module.I have also changed the image icon using iconbitmap.
Also, I have used four different operators that are addition(+),subtractio(-),multiplication(*) and division(/) for calculation. 
There are three function which displays the button in Entry box that are btn_press():update the expression,equal():evaluate the final value and clear():clear all the content.
Also, I have defined the buttons and kept it in particular place in main screen.
Finally, I started the progrom using .mainloop().
